##Mentor Web App

Welcome to the Code Mentor Web App, a platform designed to facilitate remote coding sessions between mentors and students.

Introduction:
The Mentor Web App is a collaborative coding platform designed to facilitate remote coding sessions between mentors and students. The primary goal is to create an interactive and real-time coding environment that allows mentors to share code, observe students as they code, and provide guidance during coding sessions.

Features:
1.Lobby for Code Block Selection:Users, both mentors, and students start on a lobby page where they can choose from a list of code blocks.each code block represent aproblem from the Database.
2.Individual Code Block Pages:After selecting a code block, users are directed to an individual page dedicated to that specific code block.
3.Real-Time Code Changes:The web app employs a Socket connection to enable real-time code changes. This feature ensures that both mentors and students can see code modifications instantly.
4.Syntax Highlighting:The app supports syntax highlighting for JavaScript code, enhancing the readability and understanding of the code snippets.
5.User Roles:Users are categorized into mentors and students. Mentors have a read-only view of the code block, while students can actively make changes. This distinction allows for a structured learning environment.

How It Works:
1.Lobby Selection:Users recognize as student or mentor after the get into the lobby and choose a specific code block they want to work on or discuss.
2.Individual Code Block Page:Upon selection, users are redirected to a dedicated page for the chosen code block. The mentor, who initiates the session, sees a read-only version, while the student sees an editable version.
3.Real-Time Collaboration:As the student makes changes to the code, the mentor can observe these modifications in real-time. This allows for immediate feedback and guidance.
4.Enhanced Learning:The web app aims to create an immersive learning experience by combining real-time collaboration, syntax highlighting, and a structured workflow between mentors and students.

Technologies Used:
Backend:
1.Flask (Python web framework)
2.Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket communication
3.psycopg2 for PostgreSQL database interaction
Frontend:
1.HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2.Highlight.js (or equivalent library) for syntax highlighting
